## Installing NestJS cli tool and creating project

First we have to make sure node is installed on our local machine. Once node is installed we have to install `npm install -g @nestjs/cli`.

Once it has been installed we can create a fresh nestjs project from the command line using

```bash
nest new 1-iluvcoffee
```

After the project has been created, navigate to the project and start it:

```bash
cd 1-iluvcoffee
npm run start:dev
```
